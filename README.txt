== Description ==

Tensile is an alternative payment service built for WooCommerce. Tensile allows customers to securely link and pay with their bank accounts, saving merchants more than 80% on payment processing costs. Customers are able to access Tensile directly from your WooCommerce checkout page. You can help maximize your savings with Tensile by providing incentives like discounts, carbon offsets or donations to your favorite charity!

= Lower payments costs by 80% or more =

Tensile has no setup fees, no monthly fees, and no hidden costs! You only get charged when you earn money, and earnings are transferred to your bank account as they are processed, net of the Tensile fee which is typically 0.5%.

A member of our merchant enablement team will reach out to set up your credentials and help you identify the best way to use Tensile, or you can add the bank account payment method off the shelf.

Tensile is available in the United States only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do if there is an error with my checkout page? =

Please contact us at support@tensilepayments.com and we will troubleshoot with you! Until then, disable the Tensile plugin and your other payment methods will continue to work without issues.

= Is Tensile secure for our customers? = 

Yes! Tensile uses the same technology that Venmo, Ca$hApp and others use to link to your customers' bank accounts. We do not see or store your customers' bank login information, and all other customer data is stored securely on Tensile's platform.

= How is the fee implemented? =

Tensile will take out our fee during payment processing, and the net order amount will be transferred directly to your bank account.

= Does Tensile support refunds? =

Yes! Orders paid through Tensile can also be refunded with Tensile. You can go into an order detail page to see the option to refund, e.g. see our screenshots for an example.
